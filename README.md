LOL Model Viewer
=================

This is just a clone to add a few features for [lolmodelviewer](http://code.google.com/p/lolmodelviewer/).

Original Features
-------------------
* Model Viewer: Supports nearly all champions as well as a number of miscellaneous models.

* Animation Viewer: It properly animates the majority of older champions. New champions will lack support until the newest animation format is reverse engineered.

Planned Features
-------------------

* Support for zip archive and plain directory instead of just RAF, so it will support the directory structure of Chinese version of LOL and more.
* Support to display the animating skeletons of Champions, so I can understand LOL model formats better.
